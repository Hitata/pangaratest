# Overview status
* Javascript Logic 70%
* Design 50%

# Time spend
* 30-45 minutes reading/testing out Nasa EPIC API
* 15 minutes thinking if I should use React. Decided not to, too risky as it might take too much setting up & get it to work on Lytmus
* 15-30 minutes decide on Jquery, JqueryUI, then changed to bootstrap, bootstrap-datepicker,...  
* 30 minutes coding
* 1 hour taking a break to get late late dinner
* 1:30 continue coding. Realize 1 hour left for question 2.

# Problem while work
* API document was clear when I first look at how to form a image_url
* Decide on what to use took sometime, can't or didnt want to use scss, jsx, and other pre-compile things since it might not work on Lytmus.
* 5-6 hours straight coding is not ideal for a test, with 2 question, no break time (Feel like its against the idea of freelance)
* Polishing things takes time. I'm not at level of coding a production product in this time frame.

# Todo
* Pause and Resume functions
* Self update information panel
* Polish Design
* Refactor javascript code
* error handling.
* organize files & replace CDNs
* Testing on Firefox (Chrome is soso)
